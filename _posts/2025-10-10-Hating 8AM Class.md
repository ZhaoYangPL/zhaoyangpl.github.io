## Killing me to wake up in time !

Actually, waking up at 8am is not the worst, but the place. Our classroom is in SOM(school of management), which, I bet, must be 2 km away from my residence. Torturous!

Class in the morning is 'Database', not so difficult, thus I have time to write my diary. And below is my [homework](/assets/file/习题+上机作业3A%202025.docx).

Well, it may be a good choice to review the class in the morning. [Notes](/assets/file/Notes/Database.md)

I mainly focused on comment section and visitorName system yesterday. Unfortunately, failed in the latter one. I don't think that's unacceptable or I am too weak. Every blossom need time to bloom. Same as my web. It's failure makes me strong!

And in today's work, I was defeated by 'how to decoder the encodered page'. Upset again, but i'll just put it away and let it go. **I'm sure one day I'll make it out**. Time will prove everthing.
