Recently, I've recieved bad news ina row. The first is, in summer vocation, I applied for Quant Research Assistant, but almost 3 months passed by, no results. So I sent an email to question, only to find they have turned me down. They think i was too young to do the research. And the other bad news is ZJU Investment Association also turned me down, which, i thought i will 100% attend. Fate flipped a coin and not heads this time...

I updated notes for Probability.
