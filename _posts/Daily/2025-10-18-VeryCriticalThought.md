These days I've spent lot of times in World Quant Brain,in here I learned a lot about quant. If you submit excellent alphas, you could be consultant. After that, earning moneys by that. It's a good choice for parttime job, but when I dive into it, much more difficult than I thought. Spending much time in searching alphas but still failed. I did tried a lot but still performed poorly. I couldn't imagine I spend my time on such thing! And i'm wondering whether I will choose it as my career, or at least, spending much of my time on it. 

Are these just some difficulties biginners will face?

By contrast, deeplearning maybe more attractive. Help...

I really met some chanllenges, but never have I surrend, never! Maybe I will give up, but at least I will acheive the gold medal. And I am determined on that!

I decided to record my daily life and cut down usage of phone, I think this chanllenge will be very intersting. What's more, the action 5 pro can also be used as a well performed camare. Saving me from ugly photo shoot hhh.
