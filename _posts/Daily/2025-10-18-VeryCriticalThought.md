These days I've spent lot of times in World Quant Brain,in here I learned a lot about quant. If you submit excellent alphas, you could be consultant. After that, earning moneys by that. It's a good choice for parttime job, but when I dive into it, much more difficult than I thought. Spending much time in searching alphas but still failed. I did tried a lot but still performed poorly. I couldn't imagine I spend my time on such thing! And i'm wondering whether I will choose it as my career, or at least, spending much of my time on it. 

Are these just some difficulties biginners will face?

By contrast, deeplearning maybe more attractive. Help...
