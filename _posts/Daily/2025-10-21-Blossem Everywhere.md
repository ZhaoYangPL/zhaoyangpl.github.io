4 days ago, I set a challenge for myself. Lock my phone, sense the world and capture moments of my life. Originnally, I planned to take the challenge only for one day, while friends seemed all surport my decision. So, the short challenge became to a 61-day-long one. Quite difficult, but i shall never surrender! That's my character!

And only 4 days passed, the first shot came out to meet your guys. It feels great to put ideas into action immediately. This momentum is what I need to keep going and achieve more. It's a reminder that the distance between a dream and reality is called action. Every small step, like this one, builds up to something bigger. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
