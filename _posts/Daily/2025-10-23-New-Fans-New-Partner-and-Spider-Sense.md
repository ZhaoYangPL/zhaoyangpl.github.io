As I mentioned in my daily file on the 21st, I've kicked off my "LockMyPhone" challenge series! The videos are being updated on both Xiaohongshu and Douyin. And you know what? In just two days, I've already gained nearly 10 fans across both platforms! Plus, my screen time has been successfully controlled to under 1 hour!

Yesterday, gygg and I went to KTV and had a blast, singing for a solid 5 hours. It was awesome! Hehe!

On Monday's physical dance class, Mr. Wang assigned us dance partners, and mine is super, super beautiful! Aaaaaaaaaah. And before he even assigned them, I had a hunch that I would be paired with her. Is this my spider-sense?
