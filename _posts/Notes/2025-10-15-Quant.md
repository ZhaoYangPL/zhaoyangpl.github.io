I felt I should take notes of Quant, or i will forget these knowledge.

**Sharpe**

While the amount of profit is important, how *consistently* you earn it is also an important evaluation factor for Alphas. Sharpe is the measure of risk adjusted returns earned by the alpha. *Higher values of Sharpe are better.* Sharpe is calculated as the annualized value (*√250) of returns divided by their standard deviation: Sharpe = Avg. Annualized Returns / Annualized Std. Dev. of Returns

**Turnover**

When creating an Alpha, positions change daily, and Turnover is the percentage of the capital which the alpha trades each day. *More turnover may mean higher transaction costs during trading.* the formula Value Traded / Value Held expresses this.

**Fitness**

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of returns, turnover and Sharpe: Fitness=Sharpe * Sqrt(Abs(Returns)) / Max(Turnover,0.125)

*Good Alphas have high fitness.* You can optimize the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe (or returns) and reducing turnover. Improving one factor normally has an adverse impact on the other factor. As you work on optimizing your Alpha, an improvement in its fitness is a sign that your changes are having a positive impact.

**Returns**

Returns indicates how much profit an Alpha can generate. Since BRAIN simulations assume a long-short portfolio (which we'll explain in the next step), The total investment amount equals half of the book size.

**Drawdown**

Even with good Alpha performance, *significant losses can occur during certain periods*. Depending on market conditions, large losses might make it difficult to continue investing in that Alpha.

Drawdown represents the percentage of the largest loss incurred during any year in your backtesting. As a practice, you should target a return-to-drawdown ratio greater than one. The higher the ratio of returns to drawdown, the better it may be for your alpha.

**Margin**

Margin represents *how much PnL you obtained relative to the traded amount*. It's calculated by dividing total PnL by the total traded amount. Note that Margin uses basis points (bps, ‱, or ten thousandths) as its unit of measurement, not %!

**Position**
Position（頭寸/倉位）代表在某個時間點，你希望在某支股票上的投資配置。

多頭倉位 (Long Position): 正數值，代表你看好這支股票，希望買入並持有它。數值越大，代表你看好的程度越高，希望買入的份額越大。

空頭倉位 (Short Position): 負數值，代表你看空這支股票，希望賣出它（或融券賣出），賭它會下跌。負值的絕對值越大，代表你看空的程度越高。

零倉位 (Flat/Zero Position): 數值為0，代表你對這支股票持中立態度，不持有任何倉位。

在你之前的觀察中提到「long-position會不好（會受到大市場的影響）」，這是非常正確的。一個只做多（只持有Long Position）的策略，其整體表現會和市場（大盤）高度相關，這就是所谓的Beta風險。一個理想的Alpha因子策略，通常會同時包含多頭和空頭倉位，以對沖掉市場的整體漲跌風險，賺取相對收益。

**Mean Reversion**

Think of stocks in the same industry as a pack of dogs on leashes held by the same owner. They can wander a bit, but they generally move in the same direction. If one dog runs too far ahead (overperforms) or lags too far behind (underperforms), the leash will eventually pull it back toward the pack.

This strategy assumes that when a common factor (like oil prices) affects an entire sector, some stocks might overreact or underreact in the short term. The goal is to profit from the correction when this temporary mispricing fixes itself. This is a form of relative value investing.

This way, *we can take long positions in petrochemical stocks that rose less and short positions in those that rose more*. Similarly, we take long positions in aviation stocks that fell more and short positions in those that fell less.

*** 

PV data has information related to price and volume. Since it includes price itself, which is essential for predicting stock prices, it's one of the most useful data types when first creating Alphas.

💸 **Price data**
PV data includes stock prices – open, high, low, close- and other trading related information like volume of shares traded and market capitalization. These values are well represented in candlestick charts.

Open is the first traded price when the stock market opens for the day.
Close is the last traded price when the stock market ends for the day.
High is the highest price traded during the day.
Low is the lowest price traded during the day.
📦 Volume
Volume indicates the number of shares investors transacted that day.


📋 **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)**
Additionally, VWAP can represent a day's stock price, which is the volume-weighted average price. Since low-volume trades might give a false picture of other price indicators like closing price, VWAP can be a better measure of that day's price. Let's look at this table:

10
100
11
120
12
80
13
10
VWAP
11
Here, the VWAP is 11, resulting from dividing the sum of price times volume by the total volume sum. In formula terms, it's sum(price*volume)/sum(volume).

💡 Alpha Ideas
Most Alphas using PV data come from these two main ideas:

Momentum -Assume that stocks which have performed well in the past will continue to perform well, while stocks that have performed poorly will continue to do so.
Momentum effect typically appears over longer periods (several months or more).
Reversion -The hypothesis is that if something increases today, it will fall tomorrow. And if something decreases today, it will increase tomorrow. This something can be anything: price, volume, correlation between two things or the other indicators/variables that you can think of while developing your alpha.
Reversion effect appears over shorter periods (days or weeks).

Since reversion theory assumes prices return to their mean, we can implement an Alpha using the formula "vwap/close". This takes long positions when closing prices fall below VWAP, and short positions when they rise above it.

**Creating Conditions**

setting overly restrictive conditions may reduce the number of data points and increase the risk of overfitting.

These are the examples of conditions you can use when creating Alphas.

Change positions only when volume is higher than usual

Liquidate positions in extreme situations

Limit changing positions during high volatility periods
