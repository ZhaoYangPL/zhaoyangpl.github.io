I felt I should take notes of Quant, or i will forget these knowledge.

**Sharpe**

While the amount of profit is important, how *consistently* you earn it is also an important evaluation factor for Alphas. Sharpe is the measure of risk adjusted returns earned by the alpha. *Higher values of Sharpe are better.* Sharpe is calculated as the annualized value (*√250) of returns divided by their standard deviation: Sharpe = Avg. Annualized Returns / Annualized Std. Dev. of Returns

**Turnover**

When creating an Alpha, positions change daily, and Turnover is the percentage of the capital which the alpha trades each day. *More turnover may mean higher transaction costs during trading.* the formula Value Traded / Value Held expresses this.

**Fitness**

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of returns, turnover and Sharpe: Fitness=Sharpe * Sqrt(Abs(Returns)) / Max(Turnover,0.125)

*Good Alphas have high fitness.* You can optimize the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe (or returns) and reducing turnover. Improving one factor normally has an adverse impact on the other factor. As you work on optimizing your Alpha, an improvement in its fitness is a sign that your changes are having a positive impact.

**Returns**

Returns indicates how much profit an Alpha can generate. Since BRAIN simulations assume a long-short portfolio (which we'll explain in the next step), The total investment amount equals half of the book size.

**Drawdown**

Even with good Alpha performance, *significant losses can occur during certain periods*. Depending on market conditions, large losses might make it difficult to continue investing in that Alpha.

Drawdown represents the percentage of the largest loss incurred during any year in your backtesting. As a practice, you should target a return-to-drawdown ratio greater than one. The higher the ratio of returns to drawdown, the better it may be for your alpha.

**Margin**

Margin represents *how much PnL you obtained relative to the traded amount*. It's calculated by dividing total PnL by the total traded amount. Note that Margin uses basis points (bps, ‱, or ten thousandths) as its unit of measurement, not %!

**Position**
Position（頭寸/倉位）代表在某個時間點，你希望在某支股票上的投資配置。

多頭倉位 (Long Position): 正數值，代表你看好這支股票，希望買入並持有它。數值越大，代表你看好的程度越高，希望買入的份額越大。

空頭倉位 (Short Position): 負數值，代表你看空這支股票，希望賣出它（或融券賣出），賭它會下跌。負值的絕對值越大，代表你看空的程度越高。

零倉位 (Flat/Zero Position): 數值為0，代表你對這支股票持中立態度，不持有任何倉位。

在你之前的觀察中提到「long-position會不好（會受到大市場的影響）」，這是非常正確的。一個只做多（只持有Long Position）的策略，其整體表現會和市場（大盤）高度相關，這就是所谓的Beta風險。一個理想的Alpha因子策略，通常會同時包含多頭和空頭倉位，以對沖掉市場的整體漲跌風險，賺取相對收益。

**Mean Reversion**

Think of stocks in the same industry as a pack of dogs on leashes held by the same owner. They can wander a bit, but they generally move in the same direction. If one dog runs too far ahead (overperforms) or lags too far behind (underperforms), the leash will eventually pull it back toward the pack.

This strategy assumes that when a common factor (like oil prices) affects an entire sector, some stocks might overreact or underreact in the short term. The goal is to profit from the correction when this temporary mispricing fixes itself. This is a form of relative value investing.

This way, *we can take long positions in petrochemical stocks that rose less and short positions in those that rose more*. Similarly, we take long positions in aviation stocks that fell more and short positions in those that fell less.
