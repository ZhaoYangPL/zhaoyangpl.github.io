## Hi, Mr/Miss Stranger, I'm Weekend Chen

Welcome again for your visit!

I'm a undergraduate sophomores form [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn "Official Website of ZJU"), majoring in **Information Management & Statics**.

Recently, I have studied in **Machine Learning, Deep Learing, Reforcement Learning**.And I am diving in two projects now:

1. **Video evaluation system based on AI intelligence**

2. **Quantitative investment decision-making based on deep learning**

Also, I focus on preparing GRE test, so sometimes you will see me memorize words in pain.(Actually, I forced myself to memory 50 words per day, 50 Completely Strange Words!) Bad... 

Besides studying, I'm found of **traveling**. i've been to more than 62 cities in the past year. ![My travel route](/assets/img/myTravelRoute.jpg) **Cycling, billiards, badminton, climbing, singing, waitz, chacha** are all my taste, while I'm sure not expert in all of them hhh... 

You know what, I think I can't finish strenths. If possible I could spend a whole day on it. That's ture! Well, I just selsct some of them hhh.

Anyway, perhaps, it's right time to end my introduction. 

Allow me to dedicate a sentence to you:  **Although not knowing your name, I still greet you in the name of spring & sunshine and wish you well.**
